# Heart disease prediction:

There are two ipynb executable files: 
1. Classifier: Three classifiers have been implemented and compared to check their efficiency and results. The ML algorithms that were used are:
      i. Random Forest Classifier
     ii. Logistic Regression
    iii. Decision Trees

2. XGBoost: eXtreme Gradient Boosting has been used to check for its results as well, which have turned out to be better than the above algorithms.

These results can be further improved by applying advanced preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning methods along with Deep Neural Networks.
